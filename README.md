<h1>Expobici Convention Website</h1>

I worked on the Expobici website, using client specifications down to the pixel. I did not design the page, but I did implement it using Bootstrap. I also got my client all the pictures from unsplash.com (all pictures free, creative commons zero license), and Favicons.

<b>While I did not agree with the styling of the page</b>, the client wanted it this way so I complied and delivered what he needed.
